# hotel-nodejs

Hi There!

Welcome to the hotel nodejs app. 

This app is a hotel reservation processing system. It's primary requirements are: 
- The guest must be able to check the details of their current reservation
- The guest must be able to make a new reservation
- The guest must be able to alter the details of a current reservation
- The guest must be able to delete/cancel a reservation
- This app must be a Single Page Application (SPA) to enhance overall user experience

Tools that I will be using: 
 - HTML
 - CSS local and Bulma CSS Framework
 - Vanilla JS (no frameworks)
 - jQuery
 - Node.js
 - MongoDB

Thanks!
